Motivation:
The motivation behind this work is to develop the analytical thinking process by analyzing the Youtube Dataset, publicaly available on Kaggle. This work has two phases:

PHASE-01: DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON
In this part I'll utilize Python and jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset and also try to do a predictive analysis using machine learning. Also I am going to utilize the GEN-AI tools to analyze and extract the hidden patterns in the data if possible.

PHASE-02: POWER-BI DASHBOARD
In this phase we will make a interactive power-bi dashboard which could deliver us various hidden insights from the data, also we will add some custom metrics to make the data tell its own story.
